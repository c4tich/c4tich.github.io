# GPG (GnuPG)
[GnuPG](https://gnupg.org/) is a free implementation of
[OpenPGP](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4880.txt). It is a cryptographic suite
whose tools allow you to encrypt/decrypt data, provide digital signatures,
secure communications verify integrity and much more. The excellent
[GNU Privacy Handbook](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/book1.html), although
a little out of date (`gpg v1.x` based) provides a great introduction of many
concepts used around `gpg`
